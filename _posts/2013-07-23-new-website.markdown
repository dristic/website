"I have finally found some free time in my busy day to build a brand new website", said every developer ever. Well I am glad I got my required first sentance for this blog out of the way. Now onto bigger and better things!

I want to start this blog and personal website off right. There are many reasons to redesign a website however so here are my reasons:

1. My old website was written when HTML 4 was cool. As a front engineer I felt an obligation to update.
2. It also had outdated content and I could not find the source code (because it was written before I had a GitHub account).
3. I wanted to start writing for both personal and work related reasons and needed to add a blog component.
4. The website was in PHP which I have not used in a while.

From what I have found many people, especially engineers, redesign a website for these issues. Most of them being that the code has gotten to an unmanagable point.

So I set on my task to redesign this website into something much more manageable. My first iteration landed in nodejs. As hard as I tried I could not find something that was not in the prototype stage and decided to ditch that solution. From there I wound up in Wordpress. Finding customizing a Wordpress template a nightmare I opted for something easier. Finally I landed on using jekyll which is a great ruby gem and is what you are looking at today.
