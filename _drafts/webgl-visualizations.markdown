It is an ever increasingly exciting time for JavaScript developers. With JavaScript engines getting faster, NodeJS getting more popular, and growing support for more devices JavaScript is definitely maturing into a great language. Now that JavaScript is growing, however, it is time to fix some of the conventional issues that developers look past today by using things like [TypeScript][typescript] and [CoffeeScript][coffeescript]. The major changes coming about in ECMAScript 6 hope to fix these issues for developers making JavaScript development even faster.

Much of this information is based off of a great talk by [Kit Cambridge][kit] at the [SFHTML5][sfhtml5] meetup group in San Francisco. I also spend a lot of time reading the draft revisions and reading great blogs around the web. I hope to consolidate my own knowledge through this post as well as give readers a great summary of the ECMAScript 6 space.

# A Brief History of the World (of JavaScript)

First there was man. Then there was JavaScript. This is what they tried to do with ECMAScript 4, but now became 6.

# Functional Definitions

Default params, let parameters, constants, arrow functions, spread operator, rest parameters

# Object Definitions

Classes, imports, generators, maps

# Support and Thoughts
