	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/self.jpg" alt="Dan Ristic" id="about-me-img" />
	<p>I am a front end engineer and developer evangelist for the web. My goals as an evangelist are to push the web forward with my work and help it become better every day. I currently work as an evangelist at a great company called <a href="http://pubnub.com">PubNub</a>.</p>
	<p>I am currently located in the San Francisco Bay Area where you can find me hiking, working, exploring, attending events, and playing games.</p>
	<p>My career as a developer definitely started off at a young age. I started developing in web technologies from middle school and have been on the web ever since. From there I attended the University of Advancing Technology graduating with a degree in Technology Management. Since then I have been working on writing, designing, developing, and prototyping for web technologies to my heart's desire.</p>
